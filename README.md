## Hi there and welcome to the MikeJuneBug Github page where I'll be shortly uploading a few more projects that I've been working on recently ##

I enjoy puzzles, coding in Python and dealing with data. I'm always eager to learn and improve on my skills.

Building on the skills I learned working as a Workforce Information Analyst I won a scholarship to study on a Data Science Bootcamp. I'm keen to secure a new role using the skills I've picked on the course:

  âœ¨ Python coding
  
  âœ¨ Key statistical methods to analyse and summarise a wide range of data sets
  
  âœ¨ Data collection, cleansing, EDAs and visualisation using Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas and dataframes
  
  âœ¨ Presenting and communicating insights through visual storytelling and reports
  
  âœ¨ Identifying relationships and patterns in data and spotting trends in complex datasets
  
  âœ¨ Solving industry-specific problems using data-driven techniques and domain knowledge

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to for a new Python coding project to keep my mind busy

|-----:|-----------|
|     1| :books: Learning stuff and doing puzzles
|     2| :swimmer: Coding is a new skill for me so Python. There's nothing I can't do with Python one of its libraries.    |
|     3| :ticket: Going to gigs      |
